This is an automated abuse complaint regarding active TCP port scan
(establishing multiple connections). All these connections are to dynamically
located tarpit type honeypots and thus provide sufficiently reliable evidence
to claim an ongoing port scan activity.

This means the host behind IP address {{.IP}} is either:

- serves a public proxy/VPN;
- participates in a botnet operation or another kind of malware;
- a VPS used by an illicit actor to find vulnerable publicly exposed services
  (Telnet at 23/tcp, Samba at 445/tcp, FTP at 21/tcp, SSH at 22/tcp and so on).

We insist that you and/or your end-user will take all necessary actions to
resolve the current issue. If you are an established VPN provider with zero-log
policy, please let us know about that, so we will be able to whitelist you.

**We are a hosting provider Skhron, please DO NOT block any of our single IP
address or entire blocks!**

Incident details are attached below:

{{/* calculate variables to render table in compact yet scalable format */ -}}
{{$iplen := len .IP -}}
{{range .Events}}{{with $dstlen := len .DstIP}}{{if gt $dstlen $iplen}}{{$iplen = $dstlen}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end -}}
{{$ipfmt := printf "%%-%ds" $iplen -}}
{{$hdrlen := sum 24 1 $iplen 1 7 1 $iplen 7 1 -}}

{{printf "%-24s" "Timestamp"}} {{printf $ipfmt "SrcIP"}} SrcPort {{printf $ipfmt "DstIP"}} DstPort{{range .Events}}
{{printf "%-24s" .Timestamp}} {{printf $ipfmt .SrcIP}} {{printf "%-7d" .SrcPort}} {{printf $ipfmt .DstIP}} {{printf "%-7d" .DstPort}}{{end}}
{{repeat "-" $hdrlen}}

This table contains established TCP connections (ones confirmed using 3WHS -
three way handshake, which makes our data not vulnerable to an IP spoofing
attack). These events cannot be forged and can be reliably verified even if you
use sampled network monitoring, for example, with sFlow.

Please do not hesitate to reply to this letter if you have any questions or
concerns regarding the current case.

We also provide hourly feed of all detected malicious IP addresses here:
